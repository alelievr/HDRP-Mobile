# HDRP Mobile

This project is a Unity package that allows HDRP to build on unsupported targets like Android and IOS

## Disclamer

Unity doesn't officially support these platforms, so don't expect it to work on the first try and without any bugs. Also, the API requirement for HDRP is unchanged, which means that for Android, you need to use Vulkan only and remove any other API in the list of supported graphics APIs.
